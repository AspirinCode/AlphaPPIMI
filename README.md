## Data



The original datasets can be found or downloaded from the following sources:

- [DiPPI: Drugs in Protein-Protein Interfaces](http://interactome.ku.edu.tr:8501/)  
- [DLiP: Database of Chemical Library for Protein-Protein Interaction](https://skb-insilico.com/dlip)

Note: Processed data will be made available upon paper acceptance.






## Usage

The code will be made available upon paper acceptance. The framework supports two training modes:

### Additional Data for Domain Adaptation

To support domain adaptation experiments, a feature file is required. Please follow the steps below:

 1. Download the file from the following Google Drive link:
 
      [Download Feature File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ImF9DnvqUS8RFt8SllbRYF10XPxrrnwU/view?usp=drive_link)

 2. Place the downloaded file into the following directories:
 
	•	data/domain_adaptaion/source/features
 
	•	data/domain_adaptaion/target/DiPPI/features

Make sure the file is present in both directories so that the domain adaptation mode can correctly load the required features.

### Standard Training Mode
In standard training mode, we evaluate the model using two data split strategies:

1. Random Split (random pairs of compounds and proteins):
```
python main.py --fold 1 --eval_setting random --batch_size 64  --epochs 200
```
2. Cold-pair Split (unseen compounds and proteins):
```
python main.py --fold 1 --eval_setting cold --batch_size 64  --epochs 200
```

### Domain Adaptation Mode
For domain adaptation, the data is divided into source and target domains. You can train the model with different target datasets:

For example, using DiPPI as target domain:
```
python main.py --fold 1  --use_domain_adaptation --target_dataset DiPPI
```
Key arguments:
- `--fold`: Fold number for cross validation
- `--eval_setting`: Data split strategy [random/cold]
- `--target_dataset`: Target domain selection [DiPPI/iPPIDB]
- `--use_domain_adaptation`: Use domain_adaptation for training
